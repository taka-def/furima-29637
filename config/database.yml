# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,

# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   _URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/some"

# You can use this  configuration with:
